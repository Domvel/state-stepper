![](docs/screen.gif)

## Description

This is a very jung project. Please view the roadmap, before creating an issue.
Anyway I appreciate for any contribution.

This is a Ionic v3 component.

## Roadmap

Folling is planned. Just ideas in unsorted order.

- Support Ionic 4 (not yet tested).
- Use Ionic color variables.
- Translate step.text by changing the layout. (e.g. accept steps as html ng-content.)
- Make this library neutral for every Angular project. (Not only Ionic).
- Step content. Every step in a tab container.
- Create demo website.
